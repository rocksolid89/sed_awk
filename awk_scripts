###awk scripts####

features: 
1. ability to organize patterns and procedures in script file
2. the patterns\procedures are much neater and easier to read
3. less information is placed on command-line
4. by defaults, loops through lines of input from various sources: stdin, pipe or files
5. # defaults comment character
6. able to perform matching on specific fields
awk scripts consists of 3 parts:

1. before (denoting BEGIN) - executed prior to first line of input being read
2. during (main awk loop) - focuses of looping throught lines of input
3. after (denoted using END) - executed after last line of input

note : begin and end components of awk scripts are optional

tasks:
1. print to the screen some useful information without reading input (stdin, pipe, file)
 
  awk 'BEGIN { print "testing awk without input file" }' 

2. print some mixed variables with text

  awk '{ s = "text"; print "this is "; print s}'
3. extract rows which contain 'deer' with using regex (awk script file)

  awk -f awksrc animals

4.parse /etc/passwd
  a. print entire lines - {print}
  b. print specific columns - {print $1,$2}
  c. print specific columns for a specific user - /root/ {print $1, $2}
  d. print specific column for specific user matching a given colunm  $1 ~ /root/{print $1} (if token $1 contains something what we need the print column)
  e. test for bash shell - $7 ~ /bash/ {print} ( parse only strings which containing bash shell {$7 = bash})
